# Measured of Sirio dipole antenna SD68

### Info:  

I started by setting up the antenna using the settings provided by the manufacturer in their manual.  
Then I moved the antenna, adjusted the angle, and changed the surroundings of the measurement area until the NanoVNA showed results matching those in the manual.  
After that, I carried out all these measurements.  

Not perfect, but as good as possible with the resources I have.

I create a matrix of the min and max values of L2 and L3.  
Mark every 20mm of L2 and every 10mm of L3.  
Set the antenna for these values and measure using the NanoVNA app.  
Saved s1p files for each measurement with the filename format:  
SD68_L2 setting_L3 setting.s1p
